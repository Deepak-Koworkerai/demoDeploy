The structure of an atom can be described as a nucleus at the center surrounded by a cloud of electrons.\n\nThe nucleus of an atom is made up of protons and neutrons. Protons are positively charged particles and neutrons are neutral particles with no charge. Both of these particles are located in the nucleus of the atom, which is at the center of the atom and contains most of the atom's mass.\n\nSurrounding the nucleus of the atom is a cloud of electrons. Electrons are negatively charged particles that are in constant motion around the nucleus. The electron cloud is divided into shells or orbitals, and each shell can hold a certain number of electrons. The number of electrons in the outermost shell, called the valence shell, determines the chemical properties of the atom. \n\nIn a neutral atom, the number of protons in the nucleus is equal to the number of electrons in the electron cloud, so the positive and negative charges balance out and the atom has no overall charge. The number of protons, also called the atomic number, determines what element the atom is."

Use public transportation or carpool: Cars and trucks are major sources of pollution. By using public transportation, carpooling or biking, you can reduce the number of cars on the road, which in turn reduces emissions.\n\n3. Be responsible with waste: When waste is burned or decomposed, they can release harmful gases into the air. Dispose of hazardous waste correctly and recycle materials like plastics, paper, and glass when possible.\n\n4. Support clean energy sources: Renewable energy sources like solar and wind power generate little or no pollution. Support clean energy companies and projects, and consider installing renewable energy systems in your home.\n\n5. Drive efficiently: If you need to drive, make sure your vehicle is well maintained and drive efficiently by avoiding rapid acceleration and braking, and reducing idling.\n\n6. Be mindful of product choices: Some products and practices release more pollution than others. Choose products with eco-friendly packaging and try to minimize your use of aerosol sprays, which can release harmful chemicals into the air."
